# Fabricate
Our design concept is Fabricate, a social and mobile fake news game.

## How to play
1. **Edit a News Article:** Choose from two real articles. Get creative and edit one into a fake news story to trick your friends.

3. **Flag the Fake News:** Review the edited and unedited articles and flag the ones you think are fake. Can you spot the deception?

4. **Discussion:** Discuss the flagged articles with your friends and come to a decision about whether they are fake or not. Be careful, could someone be lying?

5. **Win the Game:** Fool the most friends or spot the most fake articles to win!

## How to download
1. Clone repository to local device
2. Open terminal in VS Code and run `npm install ably`
3. In .env, add the API key
4. In the terminal, run `node server.js`
