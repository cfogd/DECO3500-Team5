        <h1>Interviews</h1>
        <p>
            We conducted in-person, open-ended interviews to better understand users in
            our domain space. Each team member conducted 3 interviews with users around
            university age that use social media regularly.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>Intro: Thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview which is being conducted 
            as part of DECO3500 (Social and Mobile Computing). Our project is focused on fake news, specifically 
            why and how people share fake news online. There will be 11 questions, and the interview will last 
            around 10 - 20 minutes. Please answer each question honestly and in as much detail as possible. The 
            results from this interview will be used for our project, however your identity will remain 
            confidential. If you decide at any point you no longer wish to participate in this interview, please 
            let me know. Before we begin, do you have any questions?
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In your own words, how would you define fake news?<br>
                (After they answer): “For the purpose of this interview, we define fake news to be intentional or 
                otherwise sharing of misinformation or information that doesn’t contain the entire unbiased truth.”
            </li>

            <li>Overall, do you think fake news is a problem? Why or why not?</li>

            <li>
                Are there any types of fake news that you find acceptable, such as satire or political 
                misinformation? Why or why not?
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Can you describe a recent time when you came across a piece of news online or in person 
                that you suspected might be fake? What made you think it was fake?
            </li>
            
            <li>
                How do you think your social identity (e.g., political affiliation, cultural background) affects 
                your belief in certain types of news?
            </li>
            
            <li>Have you ever shared news that aligns with your social identity, even if you weren't sure it was true? Why?</li>

            <li>How critical are you of information you come across online? What steps do you take to verify this information?</li> 

            <li>
                Do you actively participate in any online communities? e.g., social media groups or pages. If so, 
                describe your online community; their values, interests, chat method, and how often people are in that 
                space.
            </li>

            <li>
                What is the location where you see or receive fake news the most? Who is around you when you are 
                in this situation?
            </li>

            <li>
                Have you ever seen fake news immediately shared to another person (person looking over shoulder, 
                other person in the room talking to, etc.)?
            </li>

            <li>Finally, I will show you a series of news articles. Please tell me which ones you think are real,
                and which ones are fake. What made you think an article was real or fake? (Articles from
