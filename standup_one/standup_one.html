        <h1>Stand-up One Summary</h1>

        <h2>Findings from User Research</h2>
        <p>We conducted <a href=user_testing/interviews.html>interviews</a> with our target users to get
            a better idea of the domain and their views and opinions on fake news. For this round of interviews,
            we were not concerned with specific designs or prototypes, as we first needed to get a better idea of
            fake news itself. Overall, based on the responses of users, we found that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fake news is overall a negative thing</li>
            <li>Fake news can cause dangerous situations and leverage power</li>
            <li>Fake news spreads faster because negative news sells</li>
            <li>The only acceptable form of fake news, if any, is satire</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Experience Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify to user if a statement is true or false</li>
            <li>Break a down statement into true and false pieces</li>
            <li>Provide evidence of another source supporting the fact</li>
            <li>Potentially ban the sharing of false statements</li>
            <li>Allow the user to share true statements quicker (links and multi platform)</li>
            <li>Not hinder user reading</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Ideas</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Eye tracking application that fact checks news when the user physically looks at it</li>
            <li>
                Collaborative training application where users are given a news story and must conducted
                individual research to confirm its authenticity
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Create paper prototypes for one or more of our design ideas</li>
            <li>Complete user testing with prototypes</li>
            <li>Create higher-fidelity prototypes with sample functionality</li>
            <li>Conduct more research into the solution space</li>

        </ol>
