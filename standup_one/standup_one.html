        <h1>Stand-up One Summary (Week 8)</h1>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>We conducted <a href=user_testing.html>user testing</a>  in the form of interviews and probes with our target users to get
            a better idea of the domain and their views and opinions on fake news. For this round of user testing,
            we were not concerned with specific designs or prototypes; as a team, we decided we needed to get a better idea of
            fake news itself first. Overall, based on the responses of users, we found that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fake news is a negative thing, and it can cause dangerous situations and leverage power</li>
            <li>Fake news spreads faster because negative news sells</li>
            <li>The only acceptable form of fake news, if any, is satire</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Experience Requirements</h2>
        <p>Based on our findings from user research, our chosen social and mobile concept should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify if a statement is true or false</li>
            <li>Break a down statement into true and false pieces</li>
            <li>Provide evidence of another source supporting the fact</li>
            <li>Potentially ban the sharing of false statements</li>
            <li>Allow the user to share true statements quicker (links and multi platform)</li>
            <li>Not hinder user reading</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Ideas</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Eye tracking application that fact checks news when the user physically looks at it</li>
            <li>
                Collaborative training application where users are given a news story and must conducted
                individual research to confirm its authenticity
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <p>We created paper prototypes based on the ideas above.</p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Before the next stand-up milestone, we aim to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete user testing such as interviews and probes with prototypes</li>
            <li>Begin to create higher-fidelity prototypes</li>
            <li>Conduct more research into the solution space</li>
        </ol>
