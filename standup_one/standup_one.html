        <h1>Stand-up One Summary (Week 8)</h1>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>We conducted <a href=user_testing.html>user testing</a>  in the form of interviews and probes with our target users to get
            a better idea of the domain and their views and opinions on fake news. For this round of user testing,
            we were not concerned with specific designs or prototypes; as a team, we decided we needed to get a better idea of
            fake news itself first. Overall, based on the responses of users, we found that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fake news can be dangerous and lead to discourse between communities</li>
            <li>When ​people's ​values align with a fake news article, ​they are more likely to share it ​and/or ​believe it</li>
            <li>The same news can have different ways of being interpreted depending on values and identity</li>
            <li>Not everyone wants to put in the time to fact check everything they share</li>
            <li>Not all fake news is bad - e.g. satire can be funny, people enjoy sharing it to laugh at it</li>
            <li>A lot of fake news is spread between family and friends online (e.g. facebook)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Experience Requirements</h2>
        <p>Based on our findings from user research, our chosen social and mobile concept should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assist users with identifying false news stories through detection OR teaching
                Teach users how to fact check statements
            </li>
            <li>Separate user’s individual identity and bias from news</li>
            <li>Facilitate a social and collaborative experience that is location specific</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Ideas</h2>
        <p>Based on these requirements, we created two primary design</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pop-up that notifies you if an article is likely to be true or not</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Eye tracking - keeps up with the reader, prevents extra distractions, 
                    makes the reader read more of the text so they are not ignoring context
                </li>
                <li>Uses colour codes to create clarity for users</li>
                <li>Ability to rank statements or a scale of true to false</li>
                <li>
                    Pros: Very accurate detection, easy to use, ideal for users who simply never want to 
                    see fake news again
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cons: Difficult to create an interesting social experience, does help users identify fake news 
                    outside of using the app (e.g. in physical news media like newspapers or magazines)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li>
                Collaborative game where users are given a news story and must conduct
                individual research to confirm its authenticity
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Can involve aspects where you make your own fake news and try to use it to trick your friends</li>
                <li>Local and online multiplayer; location specific interactions</li>
                <li>
                    Could have a section on how to spot fake news that’s framed as how to succeed in the game, but 
                    it’s also applicable to real life
                </li>
                <li>Games could be themed, e.g. political, science, social, etc.</li>
                <li>
                    Pros: Could create meaningful and playful social experiences while teaching important lessons, 
                    Teaches users how to fact check sources for themselves beyond using this application
                </li>
                <li>Cons: Requires continuous engagement from users to learn how to identify fake news,
                    users could still be exposed to and believe fake news,
                    some users may not take the game seriously and not learn anything from it,
                    Somewhat lacks in originality - existing games such as "Bad News" and "Fake News: The Game"
                    exist in the domain space
                </li>
            </ul>

        </ol>

        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <h3>Inital Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Simulated system - paper prototype - user reads along a sentence (eye line is acted out by the user 
                pointing to the words they are reading) and then when they get to the statement a pop-up post it 
                not is places on the screen so the user knows that part of the statement is correct
            </li>
            <li>
                True or false game - paper prototype - get sorting into piles of true or false, timer, accuracy 
                rate compete against friends
            </li>
            <li>
                Create your own fake news - compete with other people to make their fake news more realistic - 
                have to judge theirs and others to see who in their local area can guess the actual fake news.
                This could be done with subgenres or user topics of interest ie pets, plants, politicians, etc.
                Paper prototyping - people will have paper, pens, images to use.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Before the next stand-up milestone, we aim to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Work towards higher-fidelity prototypes</li>
            <li>Complete further user testing such as interviews and probes with these prototypes</li>
            <li>Conduct more research into similar existing solutions</li>
        </ol>
