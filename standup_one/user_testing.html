    <h1>User Testing</h1>

    <h2>Aims</h2>
    <p>For the first stand-up, we wanted to gain insights through user testing on the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users ability to detect fake news</li>
        <li>What makes users think something is fake news? e.g., features of the article, word choices, topics of subject</li>
        <li>What types of fake news are seen as acceptable? e.g., satire, political misinformation</li>
        <li>How people act to validate their social identity</li>
        <li>Is the fake news that users spread or believe related to their social identity?</li>
        <li>Where users come across fake news and how they engage with it (or whether they do or not)</li>
        <li>Why users share fake news</li>
        <li>Why users believe fake news (or don't)</li>
        <li>How would users get others to believe their fake news</li>
        <li>How critical users are about the information they come across online</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>
        For our <a href="/standup_one/standup_one.html">first stand-up</a>, we conducted in-person, open-ended interviews to better understand users in
        our domain space. Each team member conducted 3 interviews with users around university age that use 
        social media regularly.
    </p>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Intro: Thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview which is being conducted
        as part of DECO3500 (Social and Mobile Computing). Our project is focused on fake news, specifically
        why and how people share fake news online. There will be 11 questions, and the interview will last
        around 10 - 20 minutes. Please answer each question honestly and in as much detail as possible. The
        results from this interview will be used for our project, however your identity will remain
        confidential. If you decide at any point you no longer wish to participate in this interview, please
        let me know. Before we begin, do you have any questions?
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In your own words, how would you define fake news?<br>
            (After they answer): “For the purpose of this interview, we define fake news to be intentional or
            otherwise sharing of misinformation or information that doesn’t contain the entire unbiased truth.”
        </li>

        <li>Overall, do you think fake news is a problem? Why or why not?</li>

        <li>
            Are there any types of fake news that you find acceptable, such as satire or political
            misinformation? Why or why not?
        </li>

        <li>
            Can you describe a recent time when you came across a piece of news online or in person
            that you suspected might be fake? What made you think it was fake?
        </li>

        <li>
            How do you think your social identity (e.g., political affiliation, cultural background) affects
            your belief in certain types of news?
        </li>

        <li>Have you ever shared news that aligns with your social identity, even if you weren't sure it was true? Why?
        </li>

        <li>How critical are you of information you come across online? What steps do you take to verify this
            information?</li>

        <li>
            Do you actively participate in any online communities? e.g., social media groups or pages. If so,
            describe your online community; their values, interests, chat method, and how often people are in that
            space.
        </li>

        <li>
            What is the location where you see or receive fake news the most? Who is around you when you are
            in this situation?
        </li>

        <li>
            Have you ever seen fake news immediately shared to another person (person looking over shoulder,
            other person in the room talking to, etc.)?
        </li>
    </ol>
